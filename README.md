# docker4gis

Quickly pull up a stable baseline for your Geographical Information System, by extending some of the Docker images for common GIS components:

- PostGIS database
- GeoServer for maps
- Postfix mailserver
- Cron for system tasks
- Elm Single Page App server
- Glassfish Java API server
- Reverse Proxy
- Docker registry

Enjoy having exactly the same setup on each server __and__ develepment environment.

Set up a new environment by copying a 10-line script, setting 5 environment variables, and issuing a 1-word command.

Migrate each environment to the next release by issuing the same 1-word command, adding the version number.
